#🚀 Code Documentation Generator using GROQ API
This project is a simple web-based tool that generates detailed documentation for Python code using the GROQ API (LLama-3.3-70b model). It allows users to either input code directly or upload a .py file to receive function-level, structural, and purpose-driven documentation.

💡 Features
Generate detailed documentation with explanation and suggestions.

Supports direct code input or .py file upload.

Uses the powerful llama-3-3-70b-versatile model from GROQ for documentation generation.

Gradio-based UI for easy interaction.

Automatically saves and downloads the generated documentation as a .md file.

🛠️ Installation
Make sure you are using Google Colab or a Python environment with the following dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install groq python-dotenv gradio
🔐 Setup
Replace the placeholder in the code with your actual GROQ API Key:

python
Copy
Edit
GROQ_API_KEY = "your_groq_api_key_here"
You can get your API key from GroqCloud.

🧠 How it Works
Input your code directly into the text area or upload a .py file.

The app sends the code to GROQ’s LLM with a tailored prompt.

Receives and displays the generated documentation.

Saves the output as a .md file and automatically downloads it.

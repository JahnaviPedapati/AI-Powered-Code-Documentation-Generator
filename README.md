# 🚀 Code Documentation Generator using GROQ API

This project is a simple web-based tool that generates detailed documentation for Python code using the **GROQ API** (`llama-3-3-70b-versatile` model). It allows users to either input code directly or upload a `.py` file to receive function-level, structural, and purpose-driven documentation.
